title={Perspectivist approaches to natural language processing: a survey},
journal={Language Resources and Evaluation},
year={2024},

abstract={In Artificial Intelligence research, perspectivism is an approach to machine learning that aims at leveraging data annotated by different individuals in order to model varied perspectives that influence their opinions and world view. We present the first survey of datasets and methods relevant to perspectivism in Natural Language Processing (NLP). We review datasets in which individual annotator labels are preserved, as well as research papers focused on analysing and modelling human perspectives for NLP tasks. Our analysis is based on targeted questions that aim to surface how different perspectives are taken into account, what the novelties and advantages of perspectivist approaches/methods are, and the limitations of these works. Most of the included works have a perspectivist goal, even if some of them do not explicitly discuss perspectivism. A sizeable portion of these works are focused on highly subjective phenomena in natural language where humans show divergent understandings and interpretations, for example in the annotation of toxic and otherwise undesirable language. However, in seemingly objective tasks too, human raters often show systematic disagreement. Through the framework of perspectivism we summarize the solutions proposed to extract and model different points of view, and how to evaluate and explain perspectivist models. Finally, we list the key concepts that emerge from the analysis of the sources and several important observations on the impact of perspectivist approaches on future research in NLP.},

abstract={Hate Speech in social media is a complex phenomenon, whose detection has recently gained significant traction in the Natural Language Processing community, as attested by several recent review works. Annotated corpora and benchmarks are key resources, considering the vast number of supervised approaches that have been proposed. Lexica play an important role as well for the development of hate speech detection systems. In this review, we systematically analyze the resources made available by the community at large, including their development methodology, topical focus, language coverage, and other factors. The results of our analysis highlight a heterogeneous, growing landscape, marked by several issues and venues for improvement.},
